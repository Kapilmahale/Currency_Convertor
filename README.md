Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in working with core web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to fetch real-time data from external APIs using the Fetch API and how to parse and handle JSON responses in a web application. I also improved my understanding of DOM manipulation and event handling to create interactive and responsive interfaces. This project helped me grasp the concept of asynchronous programming and promises in JavaScript, particularly when dealing with live data from currency exchange APIs. Additionally, I became more confident in designing clean, user-friendly layouts using CSS and in building a fully functional frontend project without requiring a backend. Overall, it strengthened my skills in API integration, debugging, and developing practical user-facing web applications.
